# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

so- **FR-001**: Content MUST be verifiable through official documentation, standards, or authoritative sources per Accuracy through Source Verification principle
- **FR-002**: All technical claims MUST include direct verification from primary sources with proper citation format using inline links
- **FR-003**: Content MUST follow Docusaurus conventions and Spec-Kit Plus patterns with syntax-highlighted code examples
- **FR-004**: Source hierarchy MUST maintain minimum 60% primary sources (official documentation, technical specifications, API references) and maximum 40% secondary sources
- **FR-005**: All code examples MUST be tested before publication with peer review by domain experts for technical accuracy
- **FR-006**: Content MUST achieve college-level readability (Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score 50-70) and maintain consistent terminology
- **FR-007**: All content MUST include proper accessibility features (alt text, semantic HTML structure) and SEO optimization

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-008**: Docusaurus version requirements [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific version not specified]
- **FR-009**: Deployment frequency [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update schedule not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Content Chapter]**: Represents a major section of the technical book with learning objectives, code examples, and authoritative sources
- **[Code Example]**: Represents executable code blocks with language specification, testing validation, and source attribution

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
