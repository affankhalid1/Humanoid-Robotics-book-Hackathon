# Module 2: Simulation

## Overview

This module covers robot simulation techniques using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for photorealistic rendering. Simulation is a critical component of robotics development, allowing for testing and validation in a safe, controlled environment before deploying on real hardware.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create robot models and URDF descriptions for simulation
- Implement physics-based simulations with realistic parameters
- Use Unity for photorealistic rendering and perception training
- Integrate simulation with ROS 2 for seamless development

### Module Structure

This module is organized into the following chapters:

1. **Chapter 1 - Gazebo Basics**: Introduction to Gazebo physics simulation and environment setup
2. **Chapter 2 - Robot Modeling**: Creating and configuring robot models for simulation
3. **Chapter 3 - Physics and Sensors**: Implementing realistic physics and sensor models

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Docker installed for isolated simulation environments
- Adequate hardware for running physics simulations

### Hardware Requirements

For this module, you'll need:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Graphics card with OpenGL 3.3+ support
- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended for complex simulations)
- Multi-core processor for physics computation

### Project: Humanoid Obstacle Course

At the end of this module, you'll implement the "Humanoid Obstacle Course" project, where you'll create a simulation environment with obstacles and navigate a humanoid robot through it. This project will integrate all the concepts learned in this module.

### Next Steps

Start with Chapter 1 to learn about Gazebo physics simulation and environment setup.
