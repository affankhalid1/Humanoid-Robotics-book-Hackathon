# Welcome to Physical AI

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on building humanoid robots with artificial intelligence capabilities. This book is designed for software developers and robotics enthusiasts who want to learn how to create intelligent humanoid robots using modern AI techniques and robotic frameworks.

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics, where AI systems are embodied in physical agents that can interact with the real world. This field encompasses perception, planning, control, and learning systems that enable robots to understand their environment, make decisions, and execute complex tasks.

### Book Structure

This book is organized into four core modules, each building upon the previous one:

1. **Module 1 - ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Learn the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) framework, which provides the communication backbone for robotic applications.

2. **Module 2 - Simulation**: Master robot simulation techniques using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for photorealistic rendering.

3. **Module 3 - Isaac ROS**: Explore NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem for AI perception, including Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS packages for computer vision and navigation.

4. **Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Implement voice-language-action systems that enable robots to understand and respond to human commands.

Each module includes hands-on projects that reinforce the learning objectives, culminating in a capstone project that integrates all concepts into a cohesive autonomous humanoid system.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with version control systems (Git)
- Minimum hardware requirements:
  - 8+ core CPU
  - 16GB+ RAM
  - NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (for Isaac operations)

### Learning Approach

This book follows a hands-on approach where theory is immediately followed by practical implementation. Each concept is demonstrated with executable code examples that you can run and modify to deepen your understanding.

### Getting Started

To get the most out of this book, we recommend following the modules sequentially, completing all exercises and projects. Don't skip ahead without completing the prerequisites, as later modules build on earlier concepts.

Let's begin your journey into Physical AI and humanoid robotics!
